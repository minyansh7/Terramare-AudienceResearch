Popular metta practice has phrases that one repeats as part of the process, such as 'may all beings be well'. Below are phrases for equanimity and non-attachment. This is just a possible way to approach it, one way to put the mind in the mode of equanimity and non-attachment, so that this state can then be abided in directly. You can try it out if you are interested. I am just passing on something which has been helpful for me as perhaps it may help others too.\\n\\nYou can mentally say the phrases, with the first part of each phrase being on the in-breath, and the second part (the 'fine') being on the out-breath. Doing this while breathing naturally, meaning not deliberately controlling the breath. Try it with eyes closed, and then if you wish, you can experiment with eyes open on some occasions to integrate it into the sense experience and make it gradually more available 'off the mat'.\\n\\nSo mentally saying these phrases while in the relative stillness and safety of a meditation posture, either sitting or lying down, and syncing it to the breathing:\\n\\n\"If it comes ... fine\\n\\nIf it doesn't come ... fine\\n\\nIf it changes ... fine\\n\\nIf it doesn't change ... fine\\n\\nIf it goes ... fine\\n\\nIf it doesn't go ... fine\"\\n\\nYou meditate like this until there is a natural sense of equanimity and non-attachment, a natural letting go into that, which might occur after only doing it once through, or it might take a bit longer with more repetitions. It puts the mind closer in attitude to the nature unconditional awareness which is the deeper reality of oneself. A letting go occurs and you more naturally abide in/as this unconditional awareness.\\n\\nDo the phrases at least once through, and then repeat as needed. When the phrases seem like they are no longer needed, then allow them to cease and then abide naturally as you are. If they become needed again at any point, then you can repeat them again, or just the ones that are needed as appropriate.   \n",

It’s easy to feel powerless in the face of such a massive issue. \\n\\nI downloaded the app out of curiosity (to top it, it’s free )and because I’ve been meaning to get back into my meditation practice(fell off the wagon). But what I didn’t expect was how satisfying it felt to know that something as quiet and personal as meditation could ripple out into something as tangible as planting a tree.\\n\\nMost climate initiatives either feel too overwhelming or too abstract. But this? It feels doable. Real. Like a tiny habit that helps both my stress levels and the planet.\\n\\nIt reminded me that change doesn’t always have to be loud or dramatic. Sometimes it’s just about showing up consistently for yourself and the planet.\\n\\nCurious if anyone else has tried it or found other apps/projects like this that link inner well-being with real-world impact.\\n   \n",

My mind wouldn’t sit still, I got frustrated, and eventually I’d give up.\\n\\nRecently, though, I stumbled onto something so simple I’m almost embarrassed: using a small, textured bracelet as a tactile anchor. Instead of fighting my racing mind, I just let my fingers quietly move bead by bead. It gave my hands something to do and my mind something to follow, without screens, without pressure.\\n\\nThis tiny ritual has helped me slow down, breathe better, and surprisingly—keep coming back to meditation, even on tough days.\\n\\nI’m curious:\\nHas anyone else here tried adding a small physical element to their meditation practice? Did it help you stay more consistent or focused?\\nWould love to hear what’s worked (or not worked) for others!   \n",

Sometimes continuous breath awareness works, sometimes intermittent fasting during the day works wonders—I can remain in a state of presence all day and even meditate during almost any activity. When I sit down and close my eyes, meditation happens almost effortlessly. During the day, when emotions and feelings arise, I can feel them, and they pass through smoothly. There is a distance between us.\\n\\nBut then something happens, and the daytime fasting is no longer as effective. Even if I manage to maintain breath awareness, it doesn’t work as well anymore—it doesn’t bring me back to the present. I get lost in my thoughts again, usually thoughts related to how I feel physically or emotionally. At those times, a tightening sensation usually appears in the center of my chest—an emotional pain that activates all kinds of nonsense: regret over past things, worry about the future.\\n\\nThen I try to sit and allow it to be there, or allow it to move through my whole body. I try to just observe my breath, but I simply cannot find my way back to the present. Sometimes only physical exercise helps—a tough workout. But sometimes not even that.\\n\\nI want to remain in presence permanently. Having already spent so much “time” in it, it feels even more painful when I can’t be present. Somehow, I want to stay in presence now—these fluctuations are exhausting. Losing presence is painful.  \\nDoes anyone have any helpful or forward-looking ideas about this?   \n",

Over the past couple of months, I’ve really begun to notice the positive effects it’s had on me, I feel much more connected to myself and the world around me.\\n\\nI’m in my final year of school, and I’ve been struggling to stay focused on assignments and complete them. A lot of the work doesn’t interest me or feel aligned with who I truly am, but I know I don’t have a choice, I need to finish school, and I want to do well.\\n\\nDoes anyone have advice on how to stay motivated and disciplined when the work feels so uninspiring? Is it just a case of “suck it up and push through”?\\n\\nI’ve been wondering if I could use meditation to help with my schoolwork in some way.\\n\\nAny advice would be appreciated, even if it’s just someone telling me to tough it out. It’s only one more year so I guess it’s really a small part of my life in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\nThank you!    \n",
      "7  I’ve been diving deeper into non-dual spirituality over the past two years or so, and it’s been wonderful. The people who’ve had the biggest impact on me are Eckhart Tolle, Wayne Dyer, and Michael Singer. Naturally, The Power of Now and The Untethered Soul have been huge for me. (also The Shift, the movie, by Wayne Dyer is on youtube and is beautiful)\\n\\nOne of the biggest shifts I’ve noticed is how much more in tune I’ve become with the energy in my body—especially when I get caught up in anxious or negative thinking. I can actually feel that energetic tension as it arises now. But more importantly, I’ve gotten much better at becoming aware of it, accepting it completely, and letting it pass without resistance.\\n\\nYesterday during meditation, I got really caught in some intense thoughts about past experiences. The emotional energy that came up was super strong—but I very gently accepted it just as it was, simply seeing it before thought comes to label or judge. And then it felt like my whole body wrapped itself around the feeling, like an inner hug. The energy then completely dissolved. Then I saw at the top of my head a kind of void. Then for the next few moments I saw every thought that tried to arise just get pulled into that void and vanished before it could even fully form. I don’t mean a void in a bad sense because I saw it as really helpful; it was pulling me into complete stillness.\\n\\nThen I saw the void open up into more depth and I saw this sort of orb—it looked like it contained every thought/mental noise I’ve ever had or ever could have and it was all swirling around and stuff. That orb then zoomed out into this vast 3D grid of infinite space and disappeared completely. And just like that, my entire self-concept—everything I thought I was or any thought itself was gone. Like dust. I genuinely felt my entire existence as a human being fade into that infinite field.\\n\\nI’ve learned a lot conceptually about the ego’s insignificance and pure illusory nature, but this was by far my clearest, most direct experience of that. In that space, there was no thought at all—just stillness. Infinite depth. And yet I was completely conscious and aware. So I just stayed there for a while.\\n\\nWhen I came out, I allowed that nice void to come back suck up any mental chatter before a concrete thought/judgement/worry could even form. Today was a great day. If I wasn’t present with what I was doing or I was lost in thought, I remembered that void and it’s just like everything in my head immediately returns to complete stillness and I’m brought back to presence.   \n",

It's not about becoming something new, but about remembering what has always been — a pure awareness untouched by thought, fear, or ego. By sitting in stillness and observing without judgment, one begins to detach from the endless chatter of the mind and experience the silent presence beneath it. Over time, this presence reveals itself not as something separate, but as the very essence of being — vast, unchanging, and deeply connected to all life. In this state, many describe a sense of unity, clarity, and peace that feels more real than anything grasped through the senses.\\n   \n",

There’s no way I’d pay for it, having gone to multiple Vipassana retreats where you are given food, a bed, shower, and optional one on one consultation for 10 DAYS without any required upfront fee. Vipassana only ask for an optional donation and operates worldwide by donations and volunteers.\\n\\nI don’t get it. What is so technical or complicated about TM that it requires special enrollment? Meditation in my understanding should be natural and simple, and free as in beer to all people. Furthermore I’m not even clear on what one gets from four days of TM class, other than an assigned mantra? I mean you just sit quietly, focus on your breathing and recite a mantra. Right?\\n\\nAny links to alternative ways to learn it for free or an explanation of why TM is not a scam would be appreciated.   \n",

      "0  This practice uses phrases for equanimity and non-attachment in a similar way to the ones for popular forms of metta bhavana (loving kindness) meditation.\\n\\nI developed this specific form that I am sharing here myself and am being transparent about this, so you can see it as a novel approach. Popular metta practice has phrases that one repeats as part of the process, such as 'may all beings be well'. Below are phrases for equanimity and non-attachment. This is just a possible way to approach it, one way to put the mind in the mode of equanimity and non-attachment, so that this state can then be abided in directly. You can try it out if you are interested. I am just passing on something which has been helpful for me as perhaps it may help others too.\\n\\nYou can mentally say the phrases, with the first part of each phrase being on the in-breath, and the second part (the 'fine') being on the out-breath. Doing this while breathing naturally, meaning not deliberately controlling the breath. Try it with eyes closed, and then if you wish, you can experiment with eyes open on some occasions to integrate it into the sense experience and make it gradually more available 'off the mat'.\\n\\nSo mentally saying these phrases while in the relative stillness and safety of a meditation posture, either sitting or lying down, and syncing it to the breathing:\\n\\n\"If it comes ... fine\\n\\nIf it doesn't come ... fine\\n\\nIf it changes ... fine\\n\\nIf it doesn't change ... fine\\n\\nIf it goes ... fine\\n\\nIf it doesn't go ... fine\"\\n\\nYou meditate like this until there is a natural sense of equanimity and non-attachment, a natural letting go into that, which might occur after only doing it once through, or it might take a bit longer with more repetitions. It puts the mind closer in attitude to the nature unconditional awareness which is the deeper reality of oneself. A letting go occurs and you more naturally abide in/as this unconditional awareness.\\n\\nDo the phrases at least once through, and then repeat as needed. When the phrases seem like they are no longer needed, then allow them to cease and then abide naturally as you are. If they become needed again at any point, then you can repeat them again, or just the ones that are needed as appropriate.   \n",

       "      <td>This practice uses phrases for equanimity and non-attachment in a similar way to the ones for popular forms of metta bhavana (loving kindness) meditation.\\n\\nI developed this specific form that I am sharing here myself and am being transparent about this, so you can see it as a novel approach. Popular metta practice has phrases that one repeats as part of the process, such as 'may all beings be well'. Below are phrases for equanimity and non-attachment. This is just a possible way to approach it, one way to put the mind in the mode of equanimity and non-attachment, so that this state can then be abided in directly. You can try it out if you are interested. I am just passing on something which has been helpful for me as perhaps it may help others too.\\n\\nYou can mentally say the phrases, with the first part of each phrase being on the in-breath, and the second part (the 'fine') being on the out-breath. Doing this while breathing naturally, meaning not deliberately controlling the breath. Try it with eyes closed, and then if you wish, you can experiment with eyes open on some occasions to integrate it into the sense experience and make it gradually more available 'off the mat'.\\n\\nSo mentally saying these phrases while in the relative stillness and safety of a meditation posture, either sitting or lying down, and syncing it to the breathing:\\n\\n\"If it comes ... fine\\n\\nIf it doesn't come ... fine\\n\\nIf it changes ... fine\\n\\nIf it doesn't change ... fine\\n\\nIf it goes ... fine\\n\\nIf it doesn't go ... fine\"\\n\\nYou meditate like this until there is a natural sense of equanimity and non-attachment, a natural letting go into that, which might occur after only doing it once through, or it might take a bit longer with more repetitions. It puts the mind closer in attitude to the nature unconditiona</td>\n",

       "0  This practice uses phrases for equanimity and non-attachment in a similar way to the ones for popular forms of metta bhavana (loving kindness) meditation.\\n\\nI developed this specific form that I am sharing here myself and am being transparent about this, so you can see it as a novel approach. Popular metta practice has phrases that one repeats as part of the process, such as 'may all beings be well'. Below are phrases for equanimity and non-attachment. This is just a possible way to approach it, one way to put the mind in the mode of equanimity and non-attachment, so that this state can then be abided in directly. You can try it out if you are interested. I am just passing on something which has been helpful for me as perhaps it may help others too.\\n\\nYou can mentally say the phrases, with the first part of each phrase being on the in-breath, and the second part (the 'fine') being on the out-breath. Doing this while breathing naturally, meaning not deliberately controlling the breath. Try it with eyes closed, and then if you wish, you can experiment with eyes open on some occasions to integrate it into the sense experience and make it gradually more available 'off the mat'.\\n\\nSo mentally saying these phrases while in the relative stillness and safety of a meditation posture, either sitting or lying down, and syncing it to the breathing:\\n\\n\"If it comes ... fine\\n\\nIf it doesn't come ... fine\\n\\nIf it changes ... fine\\n\\nIf it doesn't change ... fine\\n\\nIf it goes ... fine\\n\\nIf it doesn't go ... fine\"\\n\\nYou meditate like this until there is a natural sense of equanimity and non-attachment, a natural letting go into that, which might occur after only doing it once through, or it might take a bit longer with more repetitions. It puts the mind closer in attitude to the nature unconditiona  "
