Don't know if I'm seeing results just yet but either way I expect them since I feel results right after doing it. \\n\\nNow that brings me to my current question, i want to try out mantra meditation, so any advice on that fellow meditatators? What to expect and ofc my main question does the mantra I speak, remain in my head over time, then I want to speak something that will help.   \n",

I'm at the end of my patience levels. \\n\\nIs it okay to listen to a guided meditation,if I listen to a guided meditation I can do 10 minutes with comfort? \\n\\nAs someone whose further along in their meditation journey, would you recommend I do it without music or a audio track or is it okay to listen to something like headspace guided meditations on YouTube? \\n\\nP S:- I'm not an entire beginner because years back i used to be able for twenty minutes without any music or audio. I want to be able to get on that level again and exceed it \\n\\nMy ideal goal is 2 hours per day (Not all at once but through the day!)    \n",

I dunno. I usually put way too much context in things, please excuse the length and thank you foe your patience with reading this! \\n\\nI had a teacher who was an ex-monk when I started Tantra (about 8 years into practice) and had my first Peak Experience/UPG type Vision during meditation. He helped me out. I sincerely thought I had gone nuts. This was before the internet. \\n\\nThen I practiced on my own for a long time until 14 years ago when I went to both a Zen dojo and a Tibetian learning house. I desperately needed help at that time. I wound up just staying with the Zen after a few months. \\n\\nI left that country for home some years ago and have been practicing on my own again with no teacher. \\n\\nI just mostly do pactice sessions first thing in the morning of 15 min.  When I get home from the clinic, I sit in front of my Compassionate Healers shrine and meditate for another 15 to just turn my day of service back over to them and to thank them for any lessons etc. \\n\\nHowever, because I had a break through recently with changing some behaviours, some other unhelpful mental ticks showed up. I meditated on it and for the first time I asked my divine Trickster patron/teacher to help me out, what should I be doing for myself. \\n\\nI recieved another Peak Experience UPG like I had 30 years ago. Good info, followed it, bang on, it worked. \\n\\nHowever, ever since, its like a metaphorical skin or membrane has broken in my mind with visions during meditation. Granted, I am an extreme visual thinker, extremely prone to lucid dreaming and \"waking up into another dream.\" So I think I am maybe just wired a bit wonky in the first place lol.\\n\\nBut recently the visions I am getting now when meditating are getting far more frequent - it has slowly been happening since then, very slowly - but since 8 months ago its really picked up speed. And *way* more clear. Its like my optic nerves are on, its not my \"minds eye.\" \\n\\nLast night I suddenly was in a pure white cave with this *massive* stalactite chandalier that morphed, moved, and changed like a rippling rock jellyfish. Huge. It sparkled with rainbow prismatic light. These white cave walls with holographic light glitter, the size of an airplane hanger, filled my entire scope of vision. It was so clear and realistic I brought my hand up - but of course I couldn't see it. It was still in my bedroom. \\n\\nThey are increasing in detail and ...\"realness?\" \\n\\nThey aren't disturbing in any way. But I am a little... freaked out (?) by having them later because I don't think this is ...normal? Like am I doing it wrong some how now? I mean, its certainly absolutely amazing and all... but ü§∑ is it *supposed* to be going this way??? Should I be trying to stop this from happening or just enjoy the ride or? Should I be headed off to the Zen meditatation centre here and getting some in person help to put me back on the blank mind again or? \\n\\nThanks for any personal experience with those who have meditation  visions and letting me know its perfectly normal to have them frequently. That would be *super* helpful. And if they are a hinderance to something, let me know pls. \\n\\n\\n   \n",

Can't believe  It helped me su much last year. It made me deal with my anxiety in a safe way. It helped confront my thoughts. And most times I left feeling calmer or just nicer?... I usually do 10-20mins of mediation. It's usually mindfulness or letting go type of meditation. \\n\\nBut these days I don't know if It's cause I'm not very active or If It's cause I don't sleep well. When i meditatate my mind feels blank,numb. My awarenesses doesn‚Äôt feel spacious. I feel headaches. And not that much  better after done it.\\nDon't know What am I doing wrong.   \n",

Since 3 months I am trying out to meditate with \"AUM\" chanting. At first I was so amazed by it but with time it bacame harder to do it the right way. My session is always for 20 min. / day. Now it becomes always harder to feel the vibration inside my body. Speccialy in the chest region with the \"U\". At first it was no problem, now I am kinda desperate with it because it dosen't get better. This happened to so many kinds of meditations I tried. At first its so cool to try a new one, but with time it gets harder to practice it the right way and to be enthusiastic about it (shouldn't be it the other way around?). Can anyone relate with that or does someone have a tip for this situation?   \n",

It doesn't actually make sense.\\n\\nPeople are trying to intimidate new meditaters into thinking that the only way to meditate is through mindfulness and awareness of the moment. This puts me extremely off kilter.\\n\\nMy entire adult life I've sat. I've considered it meditation. And it is. I've sat and I've felt the universe and I've been allowed access to many new thoughts that I would have never had had I not meditated. Had I not sat. With my eyes shut and my mind silent.\\n\\nThis idea, that seems to spread like wild fire, that meditation=mindfulness and all the other things that happen while you sit are not meditation. It's like telling someone that you are only running if you know how to grip the ground with your toes. That it isn't running unless you are using your every effort to battle the ground to your hight in your next stride. To battle gravity like it is your worst enemy. That only that and nothing else is running.\\n\\nThat only mindfulness and nothing else is meditation.\\n\\nGet off of it.\\n\\nMeditation is an action. It leads to all kinds of mindsets. So many you really couldn't name them all. \\n\\nTo say that you are only meditating if you are practicing mindfulness. Yet you can only practice mindfulness unless you sit quietly with only yourself?\\n\\nYou are not meditating properly until you have a complete form of control of your own existence.\\n\\nDoesn't mean your life is going the way you want. Means you are actively understanding the control in your life. The control is you.\\n\\nSit.\\n\\nContinue being awesome.\\n\\nYou are only and always human.\\n\\nBe it.   \n",

Above all else, I hope you find something useful here that can aid your practice and journey. Much metta =)\\n\\n[Part 1](https://youtu.be/bUdn9OiYzt0)\\- What is Meditation?\\n\\nIt's important to understand what meditation is before we practice it to make sure we are doing it properly and with the right intentions. Meditation is about strengthening our awareness and mindfulness by returning to our observing nature simply observing what is happening in the present moment. It is not about stopping the mind and having no thoughts, but about observing the mind and accepting the thoughts, letting them come and go and being at peace with it. Meditation can increase our patience, joy, peace, and control of the mind which benefits every aspect of life.\\n\\n[Part 2](https://youtu.be/m-8lLq5FhnM) \\- The Benefits of Meditation\\n\\nMeditation is long known to its profound benefits on the mind and body and has been practiced since ancient times. The three main benefits that we will begin to experience from our first session are: 1. A heightened sense of awareness and greater clarity of mind 2. Greater emotional control 3. Sense of inner peace and joy. Meditation helps us in every aspect of life be it at work, at home, or with friends. It makes us more effective in everything we do because we can think with more clarity and insight. With meditation, we start creating like instead of reacting to it, or worse it just surviving it.\\n\\n[Part 3](https://youtu.be/C8pC-7x9KDk) \\- Preparation for Meditation\\n\\nWhen it comes to preparation, there are three main areas.\\n\\nThey are:\\n\\n\\- Physical preparation (maintaining a strong, healthy and energetic body)\\n\\n\\- Mental preparation (maintaining a calm, focused and gentle mind)\\n\\n\\- Environmental preparation (having a clean, quiet, comfortable and safe spot to meditate)\\n\\nPreparation for meditation is just as important as the actual practice itself and requires our attention throughout the entire day, not just the minutes leading up. In fact, preparation in a sense is its own full-time practice that we must all develop and cultivate.\\n\\n[Part 4](https://youtu.be/fPVOP1Un-e0) \\- How to Meditate\\n\\nAfter we understand the idea of meditation, its benefits, and how to prepare our mind and body, we can begin our meditation.\\n\\nIn meditation, the process is clear and simple.\\n\\n1. Find a comfortable position, back straight, shoulders slightly rolled back.\\n2. Find complete stillness of the body, no scratching, itching, rubbing, twitching, leaning.\\n3. Bring stillness to the eyes, slow down the flickering, darting and moving of the eyes.\\n4. Observe the breath and allow it to slow down, deepen and lengthen.\\n5. When the mind wanders, gently bring it back to the breath.\\n6. Enjoy!\\n\\nWhen we incorporate meditation into our daily routine, it brings much clarity to our mind, much sharpness to our senses, much effectiveness to our everyday tasks and much peace and joy to our natural state.\\n\\n[Part 5](https://youtu.be/AogtMJNleNU) \\- Managing the Difficulties of Meditation\\n\\nSometimes we have the motivation and good intention to practice meditation. But when we finally allocate some time to sit, we are dealt with some inconvenient challenges and obstacles that make it difficult to meditate.\\n\\nI'd like to discuss four of the most comment difficulties in meditation and how we can manage them when they arise.\\n\\nThey are:\\n\\n1.

Instead of at the end of the timer you hear a beep or a gong or whatever, you hear nothing at all. So how do you know the timer went off? Because you're playing soft music or a guided meditation from start to finish. When it is silently interrupted, the session is over. \\n\\nI accidentally did this tonight and I found it to be a nice contrast to using a chime, bell, traditional alarm of some sort. Even the milder ones are somewhat off putting when pulling you out of a session so I found the music just ending to actually be quite soothing in comparison. It felt almost like \"reentering\" normal space or waking up from sleep. It was odd but enjoyable. One second I was repeating my mantras and in a nice lil flow state feeling my body and the energy around me, and the next, I merely was \"sitting on the edge of the bed\". But even that sounds way too sudden and abrupt for how calm and gentle this transition actually was. I wonder if they'll all be like this? I'm gonna keep trying these and maybe report back later on if any one is interested. \\n\\nLet me know if you have tried this or if you are interested in me reporting back! I have a journal where I am keeping short entries after each session. \\n\\nThanks for reading and hello to all my fellow meditaters :)   \n",

I wanted to turn it off but was already comfortable, and the \"on\" light was irritating me for whatever reason for a minute and then I just kind of let it go.  When I opened up my eyes 5-10 minutes later, it was shut off.  It's never shut off before unexpectedly; no other lights or anything in the room or house were effected by some power outage.  Seems like a minor fluke however it kind of tripped me out.  I enjoy meditating for relaxation, peace of mind, better sleep etc... any sort of metaphysical experiences like this I'm not ready for, I'm not good at dealing with the inexplicable.  I'm wary to get back into my habit of meditating (which I just started doing regularly again after years of a hiatus) as I'm just afraid of more odd experiences such as this.  I'm looking for advice, as this seems ridiculous to be worried about but I can't really help it.  I was listening to an Osho meditatation during this as well, as he explained how God spoke to Mohammad even though he wasn't really prepared or ready for it, so this also is an odd coincidental factor furthering my fear of the unknown.  My experience seems so trivial but I'm really hung up on it.    \n",

I wasn't capable to have an individual thought. I was scrolling while brushing teeth, it was bad...\\n\\nSo I started doing small, kind of stupid but effective things to reset my brain. Here‚Äôs my list:\\n\\n* When I go to poop, I don‚Äôt take my phone. Just me, the silence, and the crushing weight of my thoughts.\\n* When I walk to the gym, I don‚Äôt listen to music. Just traffic sounds and occasional existential dread if I forget to take my meds.\\n* I eat in silence. No YouTube, no Netflix. Just me chewing like a caveman rediscovering flavor.\\n* I drink tea in the morning and stare out the window like a retired detective thinking about a case that still haunts him.\\n* I don‚Äôt bring my phone to bed. If I can‚Äôt sleep, I just lie there and rewatch every awkward moment of my life in HD.\\n* Showering with no music. Just screaming internally for a few minutes.\\n* Turned my phone screen to grayscale. Makes everything look so miserable I don‚Äôt even want to scroll.\\n* I leave my phone at home when I go for short walks. If I get lost, it‚Äôs a character-building moment.\\n* Sometimes I just sit on my balcony and do absolutely nothing. Not meditating. Not breathing mindfully. Just sitting like an NPC. Sometimes I see some interesting things, I've never noticed living here for 20 years.\\n\\nSince doing this, boring things actually feel interesting again. Reading. Writing. Thinking. Just sitting with my thoughts feels less like torture and more like‚Ä¶ peace.\\n\\nIf your brain is cooked like mine was, start with something simple. Like leaving your phone out of the bathroom. It‚Äôs harder than it sounds, but trust me, it hits different.\\n\\nAnyone else doing weird stuff to escape the dopamine trap?\\n\\n\\-\\n\\nI write about this stuff on my blog, if you wanna check it out, it's in my profile.   \n",

Just closed my eyes and sat with my thoughts.\\n\\nWhat I noticed:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ First few days were mentally loud. I was just watching my brain sprint.\\n‚Ä¢ By the second week, I started catching my habits before they ran. I‚Äôd feel the urge to scroll or judge someone, but didn‚Äôt always follow it.\\n‚Ä¢ Sleep improved, felt more rested in fewer hours.\\n‚Ä¢ The biggest shift: I stopped identifying with every thought/emotion. Like, I‚Äôd feel anxiety‚Ä¶ and instead of spiraling, I‚Äôd just see it. Weird, but freeing.\\n\\nI didn‚Äôt transcend or anything. But something subtle changed. The mental grip loosened.\\n\\nIf you‚Äôve been on the fence, this is your sign to just sit for a week. Do nothing, and watch what changes.   \n",

I then read about vagus nerve stimulation and started humming around two weeks ago and now my anxiety is at an all time low. If anybody else suffers from being stuck in fight or flight mode please consider humming, I didn't expect it to do anything but now I don't even have to take ashwagandha or other anxiety supplements.   \n",

At first it felt weird, but now I crave it. It‚Äôs like taking my brain off the hook for a few minutes. It slows everything down, even after I get up and go about my day.   \n",
            "4  I stumbled into a realization that hit me like a quiet thunderbolt: I'm always waiting for the next moment to feel finally \"good\", and it's been sneaking into every corner of my life - even when meditating.\\n\\nI was sitting meditating, doing my usual thing, when it hit me. My mind was subtly leaning forward, like I was waiting for a bus that never arrives. Not in a loud way, but in this quiet, constant pull toward the next thing. I started noticing how I do this *all the time*. I tell myself, \"I'll feel good once I get home from work.\" Or, \"I'll relax when lunch is ready.\" Even dumb stuff like, \"I'll be happy when this movie finally gets to the good part.\" It's like I'm constantly setting these tiny micro-goals, each one a little promise that *then* I'll be present, *then* I'll feel whole. But when I get there? There's just another micro-goal waiting again.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs like living under the quiet assumption that something needs to happen before I can finally feel okay. As if there‚Äôs always some moment just ahead that will make everything click into place. But when I really looked, I realized: nothing‚Äôs missing. I already have everything I need to be here now. The waiting itself is what keeps me from noticing that. It‚Äôs such a perfect trap because it feels so normal. Who *doesn‚Äôt* look forward to the weekend or the end of a meeting? But string enough of those together, and you‚Äôre not living - you‚Äôre just waiting for life to start.\\n\\nThe cherry on top? I realized I was doing this also *during meditation*. I‚Äôve read all the books, nodded along to the ‚Äúbe present‚Äù wisdom, but there I was, subtly waiting for something to happen. Like, \"Okay, keep observing the breath, stay mindful, and eventually I‚Äôll hit some deep insight or at least feel better after the session.\" It was so subtle I didn‚Äôt even notice it at first. My practice had become another micro-goal, another box to check off before I could ‚Äúarrive.‚Äù\\n\\nIt‚Äôs almost funny how ironic it feels now. I was treating presence like a vending machine: insert enough focus, wait patiently, and eventually \"boom\" peace, clarity or some deep \"aha\" moment drops out. I wasn‚Äôt meditating to be present. I was meditating to feel better. And that subtle chase turned every moment into a kind of emotional waiting screen. I mean, it‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt *know* this before intellectually - I‚Äôve probably resonated with quotes like ‚Äúthe present moment is all there is‚Äù in a dozen books and videos. But knowing it in your head and *seeing* it in your bones are two different things.\\n\\nWhat‚Äôs wild is that the shift isn‚Äôt about trying harder to ‚Äúbe present.‚Äù That‚Äôs just another goal, another way to keep the line moving.  \\nAnd here‚Äôs the trap: even understanding this can turn into another loop. You think \"Aaah, I get it now. Now I just have to practice it more.\" But that mindset is the loop. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Don‚Äôt wait for your next meditation session to ‚Äúfeel present.‚Äù That‚Äôs just the same game in new clothes. Presence doesn‚Äôt need a setup. Don‚Äôt wait. Don‚Äôt try. Don‚Äôt aim to feel something. Just look at this moment fully as it is. Not to fix it. Not to get somewhere. Just to see it. That‚Äôs it. The rest happens on its own.\\n\\nNow I understand why experienced meditators say they‚Äôre always meditating. It‚Äôs not because they sit cross-legged all day - it‚Äôs because they‚Äôve stopped waiting. They‚Äôre not using the present moment as a stepping stone to something better. They‚Äôre not chasing peace or clarity. They‚Äôre just fully here - even when it‚Äôs boring, uncomfortable, or painful.\\n\\nAnd that‚Äôs what most people miss, including me for a long time. Presence isn‚Äôt about feeling good. It‚Äôs about being real. It includes the frustration, the fear, the sadness. The moment doesn‚Äôt have to be pleasant to be worth your full attention. If you‚Äôre waiting to ‚Äúfeel present,‚Äù you‚Äôre already caught. The mind loves to turn presence into a goal: ‚ÄúOnce I accept this, I‚Äôll feel better.‚Äù But that‚Äôs just more waiting in disguise.\\n\\nYou don‚Äôt have to l   \n",
            "5                                                                                   Eckhart Tolle says:¬†‚ÄúThe present moment is all you ever have.‚Äù\\n\\nI realized I was spending picking up my phone 150+ times per day, and scrolling mindlessly in every free moment. I thought I was just addicted to my phone like the rest of the world. Truth is, I wasn't comfortable in the present moment (still struggle with it honestly). And I let my phone become a crutch for escaping it.\\n\\nI think this is the core of a lot of our issues these days. We keep ourselves distracted with our phones, our thoughts, our worries... and we never really settle into the moment. We are afraid of being along with our thoughts, and have so much trauma built up inside of us we'd rather stay distracted than address it. \\n\\nWhen you get comfortable with being present, everything is better. Like literally, even doing the dishes (or some chore you hate) can be a rewarding experience.\\n\\nBut, it's very hard to be present when our brains are literally fried from being overstimulated by phones and short form content our entire lives. Much of the modern world is literally perfectly designed to pull us out of the present moment‚Ä¶\\n\\n**Here's how I'm getting more comfortable in the present moment:**\\n\\n1. **Meditate each day:** Even if it's only 1 minute, I am doing a daily meditation. Most days it's 10 minutes. The first few months sucked honestly since our brains just ‚Äúfeel bored‚Äù but trust me and push through it‚Ä¶ you'll start to see things change, and your brain is literally getting rewired.\\n2. **Keep the morning sacred:** Tolle talks about how mornings are sacred. But most of us wake up and immediately scroll, setting a tone of anxiety and overload for the entire day. 100+ inputs before breakfast. Our nervous system wasn‚Äôt built for that. I avoid touching a screen for at least 90 minutes if possible.\\n3. **Set serious boundaries with my phone:** It's just too easy to get pulled into the dark abyss of social media (even reddit) and scroll for like 5-6 hours each day. I limit myself to 5 sessions on social media each day with a hard limit. Plus I block all distracting apps in the morning until 9am, and from 6pm onwards (using a strict setting so I can't unblock no matter what).\\n4. **Notice the transitions:** This simple practice is helping me build the habit of finding more anchors of mindfulness in my day‚Ä¶ each time I sit down, stand up, touch a door, etc I try to pause for just a second a notice that I'm here, in a human body, on a planet in space.\\n5. **Tech-free activities:** Simple walks around the neighborhood with no phone or watch. Leave my phone at home when I can. Read physical books, etc. As I've gotten more present I have started to really look forward to these tech-free moments.\\n6. **Watch your thoughts, and do the hard work:** This comes with the meditation practice, but as you start to become more mindful you can create space between your thoughts and your experience of life. You will start to notice the pattens of your mind. The loops and the triggers that pull you into an overthinking spiral. Become aware of your thoughts and don‚Äôt try to observe everything objectively.\\n\\n**A few more nuggets from Tolle:**¬†Tolle says that presence is our natural state. But phones trigger \"stream of compulsive thinking\" that pulls us into the ego mind. He wrote:¬†‚ÄúThe mind is a superb instrument if used rightly. Misused, it becomes very destructive.‚Äù Literally my brain.\\n\\nWhen you can‚Äôt stop checking your phone or chasing your thoughts‚Ä¶\\n\\n* Your nervous system stays on alert\\n* Sleep quality drops\\n* Creativity vanishes\\n* You lose access to that deeper stillness\\n\\nAnd maybe worst of all... you stop being present in your own life. In some ways I think \"phone addiction\" is a cop out for our lack of mindfulness. \\n\\nBeing present isn‚Äôt about just quitting your phone, or any one silver bullet.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs about finding balance and doing the work. And it‚Äôs a long journey. Good luck my friends.   \n",

As the title says, I‚Äôve stumbled upon a new way of meditating ‚Äî or more accurately, a conscious breathing technique ‚Äî that‚Äôs been a game-changer for me.\\n\\nHere‚Äôs what I do: I take a deep breath in for about 10 seconds, then exhale as slowly as possible, around 30‚Äì40 seconds. I keep this rhythm going for about 20 minutes.\\n\\nHoly moly, the effects are wild. After a session, my mind feels still, my body deeply relaxed, and honestly ‚Äî I feel almost \"high\" in the best possible way. It‚Äôs like my nervous system hits reset.\\n\\nI‚Äôve been meditating for about a year and tried different methods ‚Äî including mantra meditation for a year before that ‚Äî but never really felt much from it. Probably because I wasn‚Äôt doing it right. But this breathing method? Totally different experience. It's one of the best discoveries I've made so far.\\n\\nHas anyone here tried something similar? I'd love to hear your experiences, variations, or any ‚Äúspices‚Äù you add to your own practice that work well for you.\\n\\nThanks for reading ‚Äî and happy breathing!   \n",

I sat in complete silence for over 5 hours+‚Äîno phone, no music. Just me, my breath, and my thoughts.\\n\\nAnd honestly, it was incredible.\\n\\nI experienced a kind of calm I have never felt before. It was like my mind finally quieted down and just‚Ä¶ existed. No noise, no pressure, just peace.\\n\\nDr. Joe Dispenza says you can shift your energy in 3-4 days of meditation, and now I really understand what he meant.\\n\\nIf you have never tried meditation, I genuinely encourage you to start. Even just 5 to10 minutes a day can shift how you feel, think, and live. It‚Äôs not just talk ,it actually works.\\n\\nMuch love to anyone reading this. Take care of your inner world.   \n",

Figured I'd humor her and sit quietly for five minutes. How hard could it be?\\n\\nSat down, closed my eyes, and immediately heard everything. The dishwasher humming. Cars outside. My upstairs neighbor walking around. The clock ticking.\\n\\nBut that wasn't even the loud part.\\n\\nMy brain was like a radio stuck between stations. Grocery list. Work deadline. Did I lock the door? That weird thing my coworker said yesterday. What's for dinner? Am I breathing wrong?\\n\\nFive minutes felt like an hour.\\n\\nWhen I opened my eyes, I realized something. This noise wasn't new. It's always there. I just usually drown it out with music, podcasts, TV, scrolling, anything to avoid the quiet.\\n\\nMade me think about how I fill every silence. Walking to the car? Podcast. Cooking dinner? Netflix. Even brushing my teeth with music on.\\n\\nStarted doing five minutes of silence every morning. Not meditation really, just sitting. Still hear all the noise, internal and external. But now I notice it instead of running from it.   \n",

At the Nara National Museum the other day, I bought a pin badge for my travel vest, and it made all the difference. Just because they were sold out of the meditating Buddha one.\\n\\nSince I had gone to Nara to see the big Buddha at Todaiji, I decided to head to Kamakura the next day to see another big Buddha. (I have a 14 day JR pass, so I‚Äôm hopping around.) As I prepared for that trip, I learned that the other major temple in Kamakura is home to a significant collection of Jizo. \\n\\nDuring the train rides, I did more research, and have quite gone down the Jizo rabbit hole. Wish me luck. See you on the other side!\\n\\n   \n",

I wasn't capable to have an individual thought. I was scrolling while brushing teeth, it was bad...\\n\\nSo I started doing small, kind of stupid but effective things to reset my brain. Here‚Äôs my list:\\n\\n* When I go to poop, I don‚Äôt take my phone. Just me, the silence, and the crushing weight of my thoughts.\\n* When I walk to the gym, I don‚Äôt listen to music. Just traffic sounds and occasional existential dread if I forget to take my meds.\\n* I eat in silence. No YouTube, no Netflix. Just me chewing like a caveman rediscovering flavor.\\n* I drink tea in the morning and stare out the window like a retired detective thinking about a case that still haunts him.\\n* I don‚Äôt bring my phone to bed. If I can‚Äôt sleep, I just lie there and rewatch every awkward moment of my life in HD.\\n* Showering with no music. Just screaming internally for a few minutes.\\n* Turned my phone screen to grayscale. Makes everything look so miserable I don‚Äôt even want to scroll.\\n* I leave my phone at home when I go for short walks. If I get lost, it‚Äôs a character-building moment.\\n* Sometimes I just sit on my balcony and do absolutely nothing. Not meditating. Not breathing mindfully. Just sitting like an NPC. Sometimes I see some interesting things, I've never noticed living here for 20 years.\\n\\nSince doing this, boring things actually feel interesting again. Reading. Writing. Thinking. Just sitting with my thoughts feels less like torture and more like‚Ä¶ peace.\\n\\nIf your brain is cooked like mine was, start with something simple. Like leaving your phone out of the bathroom. It‚Äôs harder than it sounds, but trust me, it hits different.\\n\\nAnyone else doing weird stuff to escape the dopamine trap?\\n\\n\\-\\n\\nI write about this stuff on my blog, if you wanna check it out, it's in my profile.   \n",

Just closed my eyes and sat with my thoughts.\\n\\nWhat I noticed:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ First few days were mentally loud. I was just watching my brain sprint.\\n‚Ä¢ By the second week, I started catching my habits before they ran. I‚Äôd feel the urge to scroll or judge someone, but didn‚Äôt always follow it.\\n‚Ä¢ Sleep improved, felt more rested in fewer hours.\\n‚Ä¢ The biggest shift: I stopped identifying with every thought/emotion. Like, I‚Äôd feel anxiety‚Ä¶ and instead of spiraling, I‚Äôd just see it. Weird, but freeing.\\n\\nI didn‚Äôt transcend or anything. But something subtle changed. The mental grip loosened.\\n\\nIf you‚Äôve been on the fence, this is your sign to just sit for a week. Do nothing, and watch what changes.   \n",

I then read about vagus nerve stimulation and started humming around two weeks ago and now my anxiety is at an all time low. If anybody else suffers from being stuck in fight or flight mode please consider humming, I didn't expect it to do anything but now I don't even have to take ashwagandha or other anxiety supplements.   \n",

At first it felt weird, but now I crave it. It‚Äôs like taking my brain off the hook for a few minutes. It slows everything down, even after I get up and go about my day.   \n",
            "4  I stumbled into a realization that hit me like a quiet thunderbolt: I'm always waiting for the next moment to feel finally \"good\", and it's been sneaking into every corner of my life - even when meditating.\\n\\nI was sitting meditating, doing my usual thing, when it hit me. My mind was subtly leaning forward, like I was waiting for a bus that never arrives. Not in a loud way, but in this quiet, constant pull toward the next thing. I started noticing how I do this *all the time*. I tell myself, \"I'll feel good once I get home from work.\" Or, \"I'll relax when lunch is ready.\" Even dumb stuff like, \"I'll be happy when this movie finally gets to the good part.\" It's like I'm constantly setting these tiny micro-goals, each one a little promise that *then* I'll be present, *then* I'll feel whole. But when I get there? There's just another micro-goal waiting again.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs like living under the quiet assumption that something needs to happen before I can finally feel okay. As if there‚Äôs always some moment just ahead that will make everything click into place. But when I really looked, I realized: nothing‚Äôs missing. I already have everything I need to be here now. The waiting itself is what keeps me from noticing that. It‚Äôs such a perfect trap because it feels so normal. Who *doesn‚Äôt* look forward to the weekend or the end of a meeting? But string enough of those together, and you‚Äôre not living - you‚Äôre just waiting for life to start.\\n\\nThe cherry on top? I realized I was doing this also *during meditation*. I‚Äôve read all the books, nodded along to the ‚Äúbe present‚Äù wisdom, but there I was, subtly waiting for something to happen. Like, \"Okay, keep observing the breath, stay mindful, and eventually I‚Äôll hit some deep insight or at least feel better after the session.\" It was so subtle I didn‚Äôt even notice it at first. My practice had become another micro-goal, another box to check off before I could ‚Äúarrive.‚Äù\\n\\nIt‚Äôs almost funny how ironic it feels now. I was treating presence like a vending machine: insert enough focus, wait patiently, and eventually \"boom\" peace, clarity or some deep \"aha\" moment drops out. I wasn‚Äôt meditating to be present. I was meditating to feel better. And that subtle chase turned every moment into a kind of emotional waiting screen. I mean, it‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt *know* this before intellectually - I‚Äôve probably resonated with quotes like ‚Äúthe present moment is all there is‚Äù in a dozen books and videos. But knowing it in your head and *seeing* it in your bones are two different things.\\n\\nWhat‚Äôs wild is that the shift isn‚Äôt about trying harder to ‚Äúbe present.‚Äù That‚Äôs just another goal, another way to keep the line moving.  \\nAnd here‚Äôs the trap: even understanding this can turn into another loop. You think \"Aaah, I get it now. Now I just have to practice it more.\" But that mindset is the loop. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Don‚Äôt wait for your next meditation session to ‚Äúfeel present.‚Äù That‚Äôs just the same game in new clothes. Presence doesn‚Äôt need a setup. Don‚Äôt wait. Don‚Äôt try. Don‚Äôt aim to feel something. Just look at this moment fully as it is. Not to fix it. Not to get somewhere. Just to see it. That‚Äôs it. The rest happens on its own.\\n\\nNow I understand why experienced meditators say they‚Äôre always meditating. It‚Äôs not because they sit cross-legged all day - it‚Äôs because they‚Äôve stopped waiting. They‚Äôre not using the present moment as a stepping stone to something better. They‚Äôre not chasing peace or clarity. They‚Äôre just fully here - even when it‚Äôs boring, uncomfortable, or painful.\\n\\nAnd that‚Äôs what most people miss, including me for a long time. Presence isn‚Äôt about feeling good. It‚Äôs about being real. It includes the frustration, the fear, the sadness. The moment doesn‚Äôt have to be pleasant to be worth your full attention. If you‚Äôre waiting to ‚Äúfeel present,‚Äù you‚Äôre already caught. The mind loves to turn presence into a goal: ‚ÄúOnce I accept this, I‚Äôll feel better.‚Äù But that‚Äôs just more waiting in disguise.\\n\\nYou don‚Äôt have to l   \n",
